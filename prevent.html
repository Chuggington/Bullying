      <h1>What is bullying?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This may seem like a stupid question, however, you would be suprised. It is defined as "use superior strength or influence to intimidate (someone), typically to force him or her to do what one wants." However, bullying occurs in very different ways, which some we can't even see.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-black">There are many types to this as well, the four biggest being Phsyical, Relational, Verbal, and Cyber.</p>

      <h1>Preventing Bullying</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I could just sit here and bore you with all the definitons of bullying, but here are just some examples of things you can do against it.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Talk to a parent, teacher, or another adult you trust. Adults need to know when bad things happen so they can help. Also, Be kind to the kid being bullied. Show them that you care by trying to include them. Sit with them at lunch or on the bus, talk to them at school, or invite them to do something. Just hanging out with them will help them know they arenâ€™t alone. Sometimes, we also think we are joking around but we could hurt someone. Things you could do to stop bullying or from being a poterntial bully are to treat everyone with respect. Don't say anything rude or disrecptful, find a hobby instead of talking bad, and even apologizing helps.</p>

      <h1>Spotting Bullying</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Not all people being bullied like to go to others, and often try to hide themselves. There are many warning signs to bullying, and signs that is already occuring.</h5>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey"> These signs are: Unexplainable injuries, lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry, frequent headaches or stomach aches, feeling sick or faking illness, declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school, and low self esteem. These are not all the signs, however they are quite a few. And, sometimes it could be just friends joking around, but when there is discomfort or a change in attitude, this could be a sign aswell. </p>
